# CAR THEFT IN INDIA DATASET ANALYSIS
A dataset on the records of theft in India from 2005 till 2023

# INTRODUCTION
Car theft remains a significant challenge in India, affecting individuals, businesses, and law enforcement agencies. This report provides an in-depth analysis of car theft incidents across India from 2005 to 2023. By examining trends, hotspots, and recovery rates, we aim to identify patterns that can help in formulating effective preventive measures. The analysis is based on a dataset covering 10,000 car theft cases, highlighting key factors such as the most targeted car brands, theft trends over time, geographical distribution, and the impact of anti-theft technologies like GPS tracking. This report will help stakeholders, including law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and vehicle owners, to understand car theft dynamics and implement strategies to reduce crime rates and improve vehicle recovery efforts.

# DATA EXPLORATION
### How the Data Was Collected
The dataset was gotten from Kaggle Datasets which contains a summary of car theft in India.

# Features Identified from the Analysis

## THEFT TRENDS
Analyzing car theft trends over time helps identify patterns and predict future risks. The data reveals this key insights:
+ Theft Over the Years
+ Theft by Brand and Fuel-Type
+ Theft by States
In light of these insights, data-driven recommendations believed to reduce and prevent high-risks incidents are mentioned.

### Theft Over the Years
INSIGHTS
+ The highest number of stolen vehicles were manufactured between 2014 and 2017 with an average of 500 vehicles per years, suggesting older models are more vulnerable.
+ A decline in thefts for newer models (post-2018), indicates improved vehicle security features.

RECOMMENDATIONS
+ Encourage owners of older vehicles to install modern anti-theft devices (GPS trackers, alarm systems)
+ Vehicle owners should be educated on safe parking practices such as using secure garages
+ Newer models with keyless entry should adopt motion-sensing key fobs to prevent hacking

### Theft by Brand and Fuel-Type
INSIGHTS
+ Thefts is fairly distributed among different brands, but Toyota, Hyundai, Honda, and Maruti have higher theft rates which can be due to high market demand for resale value and parts.
+ Petrol and Diesel cars have higher theft numbers compared to CNG and Electric Cars
+ Electric Vehicles (EVs) have lower theft rates, possibly due to GPS tracking features

RECOMMENDATIONS
+ Owners of frequently stolen brands should install advanced security features (GPS trackers). 
+ Since petrol and diesel cars are stolen more often, owners should be encouraged to park in secured locations.
+ GPS tracking should be promoted across all fuel types, including CNG and Diesel models, to improve the chances of vehicle recovery

### Thefts by State
INSIGHTS
+ Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra have the highest car theft incidents, making them high-risk zones 
+ Theft rates are significantly higher in urban cities likely due to higher vehicle density and anonymity in large crowds.

RECOMMENDATIONS 
+ Increase police patrols in high risk areas, such as parking lots, highways and densely populated urban centers
+ encourage the mandatory installation of GPS trackers in newly registered vehicles in high theft States.
+ run awareness campaign in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra about theft risk and prevention measures

## STOLEN VEHICLES ANALYSIS
+ The total numbers of stolen vehicles report from (2005-2023) across India is 10000 vehicles.
+ Only 3041 vehicles (30.4%) were recovered, leaving 6959 unrecovered, indicating a challenge in tracking stolen cars.
+ Older vehicles between 2013-2017 are more vulnerable to being stolen.
+ Urban areas experience more thefts due to higher vehicle density and ease of movement for criminals.
+ 69.6% vehicles remain unrecovered
+ Non GPS vehicles are less frequently recovered

## CONCLUSION
Below are the recommendation / strategies car theft incidents can be reduced and recovery rates can be significantly improved if implemented.
+ Encourage vehicle owners to install GPS trackers and advanced security measures
+ Strengthen law enforcement efforts in high efforts in high theft regions
+ Use AI-based surveillance and real-time tracking to improve recovery rates
